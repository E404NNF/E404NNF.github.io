This is a public service announcement to anyone who is foolish enough to still be using Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista, and also Windows XP.
Your operating system is now fully compromised. and no, this isn't the same as Indian scammers trying to hold your data hostage for Google play cards or pictures of bobs and vagens or the CIA backdooring your operating system so they can spy on you, it is far worse than that.
The international hacker known as 4Chan has successfully reverse-engineered your operating system, THEY KNOW THE SOURCE CODE, they observed all of Windows XP vulnerabilities which means they know the vulnerabilities of all Windows operating systems that have come after it, because, let's face it, ever since Windows XP all Microsoft has really done is create some new themes for your desktop and add more spyware to Windows and also push out updates. and things are about to get EVEN WORSE, you thought viruses like WannaCry cause a lot of damage? that's child's play, the viruses of old were created by much less skilled hackers that didn't even have the sourcecode of your operating system but now, Microsoft spaghetti code, it's out in the open
